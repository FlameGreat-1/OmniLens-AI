# OmniLens AI Architecture

## Overview
NebulaVision Pro follows a modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The application is built using Python and leverages various libraries for image processing, machine learning, and GUI development.

## Core Components

### 1. Main Application (OmniLensAI.py)
- Entry point of the application
- Initializes the GUI and manages the overall application flow

### 2. Image Processor (image_processor.py)
- Handles basic and advanced image processing operations
- Utilizes OpenCV and scikit-image libraries

### 3. Object Detector (object_detector.py)
- Implements object detection and tracking functionality
- Uses TensorFlow and pre-trained models for detection

### 4. Auto Enhancer (auto_enhancer.py)
- Provides AI-driven automatic image enhancement
- Combines multiple image processing techniques for optimal results

### 5. Cloud Manager (cloud_manager.py)
- Manages interactions with cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
- Handles upload and download operations

### 6. Social Media Manager (social_media_manager.py)
- Facilitates sharing of processed images to social media platforms
- Integrates with Twitter and Facebook APIs

### 7. Collaboration Manager (collaboration_manager.py)
- Enables real-time collaboration features
- Implements WebSocket communication for live updates

### 8. Version Control (version_control.py)
- Manages undo/redo functionality and version history
- Stores intermediate states of image processing

## Data Flow
1. User loads an image through the GUI
2. Image is processed by the Image Processor or Object Detector
3. Processed image can be further enhanced by the Auto Enhancer
4. Results are displayed in the GUI
5. User can save locally, upload to cloud, or share on social media

## External Dependencies
- OpenCV: Image processing operations
- TensorFlow: Object detection and machine learning tasks
- PyQt5: GUI framework
- Boto3: AWS S3 integration
- Google Cloud Storage Client Library: Google Cloud integration
- Azure Blob Storage Client Library: Azure integration
- Tweepy: Twitter API integration
- Facebook SDK: Facebook API integration

## Scalability Considerations
- Multi-threading is used for computationally intensive tasks to maintain UI responsiveness
- Cloud integration allows for offloading of storage and some processing tasks
- Modular design allows for easy addition of new features and algorithms

## Security
- User authentication for cloud and social media services
- Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- Data encryption for cloud uploads and downloads

## Future Enhancements
- Implement GPU acceleration for faster image processing
- Add support for additional cloud storage providers
- Expand social media integration to include more platforms
- Develop a plugin system for third-party feature extensions
